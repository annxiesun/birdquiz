## ABOUT
FeatherFinder was a fun little project I wanted to do to practice my React skills & explore ways to enhance user experiences. I also wanted to explore branding & gave this site a modern yet ethereal look.

I think interactivity is a great way to capture a user's attention so I wanted to explore that. Below are some of the fun things I added to achieve that:

 - Custom mouse cursor
 - Flippable & interactive card so the user has an active role in 'generating' the result
 - Animations

## MADE WITH

 - Javascript
 - HTML/CSS
 - React
 - Node
